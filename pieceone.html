            The Orient's One Policy, Two Standards: Protected Free Speech, Unless You Are a U.S. Citizen.
          </h1>

          <p>Dear Community,</p>

          <p>On April 4th, the Editor-in-Chiefs of the Orient changed a longstanding policy. Previously, any member affiliated with the College would be able to write an opinion piece in the Orient, and in doing so, they understood that their article would not be removed under any circumstance. The new Orient policy allows only opinion pieces by non-U.S. citizens to be removed.</p>

          <p>In wake of this new policy, we are worried about the broader impacts on our community.</p>

          <p>The intent of the policy is to protect non-U.S. citizens from potential risks due to their immigration status. However, non-U.S. citizens and U.S. citizens at the College should be treated equally. Implementing policies with two standards, no matter whom it benefits, counters this.</p>

          <p>Here at the College, we pride ourselves on fostering a community of diverse viewpoints and open dialogue. If we as an institution are committed to these values, speech should be protected equally for all membersâ€”regardless if you are a U.S. citizen or not. We should not create a precedent for future policies to allow our community members to be treated differently. Ask yourself this: Where will it end?</p>

          <p>Our goal in sharing this is to continue working towards a campus in which all voices are heard equally.</p>

          <p>Contact the Orient, Student Government, and the Senior Vice President for Inclusion and Diversity to voice your concerns.</p>
